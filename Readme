# miflora-go

A Golang application for reading data from Xiaomi Mi Flora plant sensors.

## Features

- Configurable by YAML or command line parameters
- Retrieves data from the sensor, such as battery, humidity, nutrient, soil moisture and temperature.

## Installation

1. Install Golang on your computer if you don't have it already.
2. Clone the repository: git clone `https://github.com/darox/miflora-go`
3. Build the application: go build

## Usage

Under Linux, the application uses the mac address to connect to devices; under MacOs the UUID.

1. Specify the mac address or UUID in the configuration file or command line parameter. Otherwise the application will search for devices named "Flower care" per default.
2. The application will now scan the device and printout the result
